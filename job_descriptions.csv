Overview
The Data Science and Health Economics Team provides advanced analytical support across VNSNY’s health plans. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.
Responsibilities
About the Role:
The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across VNSNY’s health plans in these four applications of data science:
Clinical – “Who are our most vulnerable members? What can we do to prevent or mitigate their poor health outcomes? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates the effectiveness of programs and interventions that aim to improve member outcomes.
Quality & Satisfaction – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to member outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care and satisfaction of our members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality and satisfaction measurement and risk adjustment; identify viable opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality and member satisfaction.
Costs & Revenue – “How are costs trending over time? Are our spending patterns in line with our revenues and the severity of our membership? “Our data scientists are knowledgeable about medical claims data and the risk-adjustment models that determine our revenues; analyze opportunities for cost saving strategies; forecast future expenditures; identify patterns of utilization among service providers, member cohorts and longitudinally over our member’s continuum of care.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable members? How will new payment methods affect the way we ensure quality care while managing costs? What partnerships can we develop to ensure that our members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while minimizing spending.
You Are:
Looking for an opportunity to perform hands-on data analysis to solve a wide variety of business problems while working alongside clinical/business stakeholders
Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently
Obsessive about streamlining data and modeling processes; if you find you or your colleagues doing something several times, you create a standard reproducible workflow
Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients
Qualifications
Requirements:
MS in statistics, biostatistics, mathematics, econometrics, epidemiology, computer science, or other quantitative fields

Solid understanding of relational databases
Expertise in supervised and unsupervised data mining and modeling techniques
Demonstrated experience executing reproducible and rigorous analyses
Strong verbal, visual, and written skills, with experience communicating results of complex data analyses to non-technical stakeholders
Expertise in translating business needs into relevant data-driven deliverables and analyses
Excellent interpersonal communication skills and ability to work collaboratively across different teams

Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

Benefits
Working at Cleanlab is awesome! Beyond the opportunity to work at a well-funded AI startup with an incredible, friendly founding team of MIT graduates, all full-time employees receive the following:
Annual travel stipend
Travel enhances our empathy with different cultures and enables us to work together more effectively. It’s how we grow and learn: traveling is an essential part of what makes us human. At Cleanlab, every two months you will receive a reimbursable travel benefit. This is a unique benefit that lets you work from Paris for a week in February, then take a backpacking trip in the Andes for a weekend in March.
Premium health insurance (+ dental and vision)
We provide a fantastic $4 (we cover the rest) health insurance option. We also provide a $0 deductible 100% coverage premium health care option for those who prefer the best health insurance.
Stipend for attending conferences to keep up with the latest innovations in ML and software.
Competitive salary (+ equity offering for certain roles), with regular opportunities for a raise if things are going well.
About Us
Prior to Cleanlab, our founders (3 ML PhDs from MIT) worked at OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, AWS, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Dropbox, Oculus, Palantir, NASA, General Electric, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, MIT, Harvard, and Stanford – at every place we worked we repeatedly encountered the same issue – AI solutions failed to work reliably on real-world, human-centric data due to label errors and poor data quality. So, we spent eight years of PhD research at MIT inventing a new field to solve this problem and after successful pilots with world-leading organizations, Cleanlab emerged.
Everything we do at Cleanlab is guided by our north star – to improve the world’s ML data more easily and quicker than any other solution – enabling AI systems to train more reliably on real-world, messy, error-prone data. We develop next-generation data-centric AI, open-source algorithms and provide no-code SaaS enterprise solutions to help individuals and teams at companies (across all industries) diagnose/fix issues in their datasets and produce more reliable ML models by providing clean labels for training.
While many companies can help store/manage data or develop ML models, there exist few solutions today to improve the quality of existing data, which is the core asset of the modern enterprise. This is where you come in. At Cleanlab, you’ll be able to take ownership of critical projects that pioneer the future of data-centric AI.
We are a hybrid company, with over half of our team (and office) located in San Francisco.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. A security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!
We made the Internet what it is today. But Cisco didn’t just build the Internet. We keep building it. Our edge doesn’t come from technology. It comes from our people. We are leaders with vision, tech geeks, pop culture aficionados, and we even have a few purple haired rock stars. We celebrate the creativity and diversity that fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers. We Are Cisco.
